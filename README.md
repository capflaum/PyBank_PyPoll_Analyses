## PyBank

Tasked with creating a Python script for analyzing the financial records of a company with a simple set of financial data called [budget_data.csv](PyBank/resources/budget_data.csv). The dataset is composed of two columns: `Date` and `Profit/Losses`.

* The Python script will analyze the records to calculate each of the following:

  * The total number of months included in the dataset

  * The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period

  * The average of the changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period

  * The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

  * The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period

* In addition, final script will print the analysis to the terminal and export a text file with the results.

## PyPoll

Tasked with helping a small, rural town modernize its vote counting process.

* Using a set of poll data called [election_data.csv](PyPoll/resources/election_data.csv), the task is to create a Python script that analyzes the votes and calculates each of the following:

  * The total number of votes cast

  * A complete list of candidates who received votes

  * The percentage of votes each candidate won
